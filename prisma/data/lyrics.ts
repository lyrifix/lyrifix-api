// I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser\n
// Midnights become my afternoons\n
// When my depression works the graveyard shift\n
// All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room\n
// I should not be left to my own devices\n
// They come with prices and vices\n
// I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)\n
// I wake up screaming from dreaming\n
// One day I'll watch as you're leaving\n
// 'Cause you got tired of my scheming\n
// (For the last time)\n
// It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me\n
// At tea time, everybody agrees\n
// I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror\n
// It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n
// Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby\n
// And I'm a monster on the hill\n
// Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city\n
// Pierced through the heart, but never killed\n
// Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism\n
// Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)\n
// I wake up screaming from dreaming\n
// One day I'll watch as you're leaving\n
// And life will lose all its meaning\n
// (For the last time)\n
// It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)\n
// At tea time, everybody agrees\n
// I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror\n
// It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n
// I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money\n
// She thinks I left them in the will\n
// The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out\n
// "She's laughing up at us from hell"\n
// It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me\n
// It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me\n
// It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees\n
// It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)\n
// At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees)\n
// I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror\n
// It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\n
