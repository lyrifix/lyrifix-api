I try to run away and end up racing towards you
From all of my mistakes, to the sweetest sound
I can't recall the days, the life I had before you
Oh, darling, if I stayed, could it be awhile?

What can I do?
What can I say?
I never knew that I could feel this way

It's you, baby, you're all that I could think about
You, baby, you got me turnin' inside out
What can I do?
What can I say?
I never knew that I could feel this way

Everything is changing
You're rewriting pages
Yeah, you come crashing in like a dream that I can't stop chasing
And everything's about you
My heart is where you take it
I'm home when you're around no matter what the place is

What can I do?
What can I say?
I never knew that I could feel this way

It's you, baby, you're all that I could think about
You, baby, you got me turnin' inside out
What can I do?
What can I say?
I never knew that I could feel this way

It's you, baby, you're all that I could think about
You, baby, you got me turnin' inside out
What can I do?
What can I say?
I never knew that I could feel this way

It's you, baby, you're all that I could think about
You, baby, you got me turnin' inside out
What can I do?
What can I say?
I never knew that I could feel this way
