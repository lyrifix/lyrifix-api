These are the better days
If not today must be tomorrow
If not today must be
These are the better days
If not today must be tomorrow
If not today must be

They said I'm getting old
Well, I've been wearing an old boots
They said I need to stop dreaming
Stop dreaming, don't stop dreaming
They said things could be worse
Well, things can always get better
They said I need to stop trying
Stop trying, don't stop trying

These are the better days
If not today must be tomorrow
If not today must be
These are the better days
If not today must be tomorrow
If not today must be

They don't even see my vision
They can't understand my intention
Not living up to expectation
No expectation
Toast for everything love's grown
It has been beautiful
The best things in life won't fade away
The best things in life are felt

These are the better days
If not today must be tomorrow
If not today must be
These are the better days
If not today must be tomorrow
If not today must be
These are the better days
If not today must be tomorrow
If not today must be
These are the better days
If not today must be tomorrow
If not today must be

Will you find me lights in the dark?
I wanna see
My purpose in life completely
Will you find me lights in the dark?
I wanna see
My purpose in life completely
(Oh my, my purpose in life)
My purpose in life completely
(Oh my, my purpose in life)
My purpose in life completely

All the way, all the way up
You will find love, you will find love
All the way, all the way up
You will find love, you will find love
All the way, all the way up
You will find love, you will find love
