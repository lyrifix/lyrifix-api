I'm busy dancing, baby
Why you keep on standing in my light?
Stop, you don't wanna get no closer
'Cause a touch like mine might end your life

Hmm, I know that look, I've seen it before
And I'm keeping score
Got you right where I want you
How you like that, baby?
You been way too busy playing yourself
Ain't nobody else
Won't see me comin', but I'm comin' (Comin')

Straight for the heart (Straight for the heart)
You never seen a sniper lookin' this cute
My favorite part (Straight for the heart)
I get to look you in the eyes when I shoot

Straight for the heart (Straight for the heart)
You never seen a sniper lookin' this cute
My favorite part (Straight for the heart)
I get to look you in the eyes when I shoot

I'm aiming the truth at you
Don't test me, you know it's poof
Your ego ain't bulletproof
I'm comin'
Straight for the heart (Straight for the heart)
Want you to feel me take control over you

Trust me, I won't be gentle
If you make me say it a second time (Second time)
So cover up 'cause your ego is showing
Like you've never heard a no in your life

Hmm, I know that look, I've seen it before
And I'm keeping score
I got you right where I want you
How you like that, baby?
You been way too busy playing yourself
Ain't nobody else, won't see me comin'
But I'm comin' (Comin')

Straight for the heart (Straight for the heart)
You never seen a sniper lookin' this cute
My favorite part (Straight for the heart)
I get to look you in the eyes when I shoot, hey

I'm aiming the truth at you
Don't test me, you know it's poof
Your ego ain't bulletproof
I'm comin'
Straight for the heart, h-h-heart (Heart, heart)
Want you to feel me take control over you (Ooh, you)

Hm, I know that look, I've seen it before
Mouth on the floor
I got you right where I want you
How you like that, baby?
You been way too busy playin' yourself
Ain't nobody else, won't see me comin'
But I'm comin' (Comin')

Straight for the heart (Straight for the heart)
You never seen a sniper lookin' so cute
My favorite part (Straight for the heart)
I get to look you in the eyes when I shoot
(No, woah, oh-oh)

I'm aiming the truth at you (Oh, oh)
Don't test me, you know it's poof (Oh, oh)
Your ego ain't bulletproof
I'm comin'
Straight for the heart (Straight for the heart)
I'm aiming the truth at you (Straight for the heart)
Don't test me, you know it's poof (Hey)
Your ego ain't bulletproof
I'm comin' (Your ego ain't bulletproof)

Ooh, and I bet you know I do
You know I do, hey, yeah
Ooh, and I bet you know I do
Hey, yeah
(How you like that, baby?)
