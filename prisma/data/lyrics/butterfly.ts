Y'all don't have my pity, uh
She the only bitch that make me clingy, uh
Spending all this bread making me feel like I've been sinning, uh
Goin' dumb my ignorance is bliss, uh
Dick got her going crazy
All these messages and paragraphs she sent
I don't think we better off as friends
Why you hang with him? He's a real piece of shit
Baby, got me all fucked up
I'm singing notes like Brent
Rolling up don't sound good
I'm looking at this drink

Can't do no rolling up, pouring up
I cannot blur the lens
Feeling loose, feeling good
Then I'm thinkin' what could've been
My eyes, open wide, I know they never lie
She get weak for the dick, a feeling I recognize
Back in 2010 I wanted to get me some friends
(Get me some friends)
And in 2024 I went out and copped me some land (Cop me that bitch)
I heard you got a lot of hoes
Your neck lookin’ like an eclipse, uh
But what they say about me?
Just wait 'till you see where he lives (Yeah)

Time files and the sunrise ain't nothing like it
Loud mouth but actin' hard is a buzz, I guess
Two face, I put it to the side
You and I, that shit is day and night

Y'all don't have my pity, uh
She the only bitch that make me clingy, uh
Spending all this bread making me feel like I've been sinning, uh
Goin' dumb my ignorance is bliss, uh
Dick got her going crazy
All these messages and paragraphs she sent
I don't think we better off as friends
Why you hang with him? He's a real piece of shit
Baby, got me all fucked up
I’m singing notes like Brent
Rolling up don't sound good
I'm looking at this drink

Yeah, aye
Games all aside
Need you to get the fuck out of my life, heh
I got my issues, no, I do not need butterflies
It come with a price
Don’t wanna hear no, “Can you try for me?”
All your hoes too shy to me
Need to get a new vice really
I ain’t been in one fight but he gon’ bleed over my bitch (Bitch)
Had a taste of real love and I wasn't ready for all that shit (Nah)
Yeah, my type's been older
All that other shit's childish
If we been goin' through it
I'm gon' keep the shit private

Time flies and the sunrise ain't nothing like it
Loud mouth but actin' hard is a buzz, I guess
Two face, I pull it to the side
You and I, that shit is day and night

Y'all don't have my pity, uh
She the only bitch that make me clingy, uh
Spending all this bread making me feel like I've been sinning, uh
Goin' dumb my ignorance is bliss, uh
Dick got her going crazy
All these messages and paragraphs she sent
I don't think we better off as friends
Why you hang with him? He's a real piece of shit
Baby, got me all fucked up
I'm singing notes like Brent
Rolling up, don't sound good
I'm looking at this drink

Come with me
I don't want you to go home tonight
It's too cold for you to fly
