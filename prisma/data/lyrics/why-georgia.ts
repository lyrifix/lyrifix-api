I am driving up
85 in the
Kind of morning that
Lasts all afternoon
I'm just stuck inside the gloom
Four more exits to
My apartment but
I am tempted to
Keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

'Cause I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, why Georgia why?

I rent a room and I
Fill the spaces with
Wooden places to
Make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just a stirring in my soul

Either way
I wonder sometimes about the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, why Georgia why?

So what so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down
Everybody is
Just a stranger but
That's the danger in
Going my own way
I guess it's a price I have to pay

Still
"Everything happens
For a reason"
Is no reason not to ask myself

If I'm living it right
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why, tell me why
Why, why Georgia why?
